# Assignment1 - Part A

This website represents a clothing store, where users can buy different things for men women and kids. They also have premium sneakers.
I have designed a logo for the page right next to the main heading which will redirect me to the webpage.
In the background there is music being played.
In the bottom there are buttons directing to different sections on the page.
There is also a contact us page in the screen with a form, which gives a message on submitting.
External Fonts have been added
